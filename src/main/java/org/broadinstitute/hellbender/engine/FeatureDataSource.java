/**
 * Enables traversals and queries over sources of Features, which are metadata associated with a location
 * on the genome in a format supported by our file parsing framework, Tribble. Examples of Features are
 * VCF records and hapmap records.
 *
 * Two basic operations are available on this data source:
 *
 * -Iteration over all Features in this data source, optionally restricted to Features overlapping
 *  a set of intervals if intervals are provided via {@link #setIntervalsForTraversal(List)}. Traversal
 *  by a set of intervals requires the file to have been indexed using the bundled tool IndexFeatureFile.
 *  The set of intervals provided MUST be non-overlapping and sorted in increasing order of start position.
 *
 * -Targeted queries by one interval at a time. This also requires the file to have been indexed using
 *  the bundled tool IndexFeatureFile. Targeted queries by one interval at a time are unaffected by
 *  any intervals for full traversal set via {@link #setIntervalsForTraversal(List)}.
 *
 * To improve performance in the case of targeted queries by one interval at a time, this class uses a caching
 * scheme that is optimized for the common access pattern of multiple separate queries over intervals with
 * gradually increasing start positions. It optimizes for this use case by pre-fetching records immediately
 * following each interval during a query and caching them. Performance will suffer if the access pattern is
 * random, involves queries over intervals with DECREASING start positions instead of INCREASING start positions,
 * or involves lots of very large jumps forward on the genome or lots of contig switches. Query caching
 * can be disabled, if desired.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of Feature returned by this data source
